Mounting unencrypted backup to "$BORG_MOUNTPOINT"

Enter the password for your backup. The warning that the repository
was previously located somewhere else can be ignored safely.
After entering the password, wait a bit and hit F5 in
the file explorer to see the files. You'll need some patience, loading
the directory structure for the first time takes a while.
The backup is mounted read-only.
When you're done, hit Ctrl+C in this window.
